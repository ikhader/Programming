Containers are available in STL library

sequence container
  * stores data by position in linear order:
  * first, second, thrid element
  ex: vector, queue, list

associate container:
  * stores elements by keys -- map
    ex: set, multiset
        Map, multimap

adapter container:
  * contains another container as its underlynig storage
    ex: stack, queue, priority_queue
    


types of containers:
vector: dynamic arrays
queue:
stack
heaps (priority_queue)
linked lists (list)
trees (set)
associative arrays (map)


example:
set.cpp
set ==> will have just a 'key', repetetion not allowd
map ==> will have 'key, value' ==> key must be unique. NO repetition
mutliset ==> same as set, but repetetion is & stored and listed
multimap ==> same as map, repetetion allowd, stored & listed
