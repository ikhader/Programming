python notes:
  'print' to messages
  if elif else
  for; while


Lists:
  l = [1, 2, 3]
  print l         ==> 1 2 3 
  l[0] = '22'    
  print l         ==> 22 2 3 
  l.del(0) 
  print l         ==> 2 3 
  l.append(33)
  print l         ==> 2 33 
  print l.len  ==> 2
  

Tupples: a sequence of immutable python objects
  t = (1, 2, 3)

dictonary/Hash:
  h = {'a' : 1,'b' : 2,'c' : 3,'d' : 4,'e' : {"hello" : "world"} }

Hash to Json:
import json json.dumps(h)

Mutable/Immutable:
read file mutable_immutable.py + class.py
example: s = "hello" #string
         s[0] = 'H' ==> gives error
         l = [1, 2, 3] #list
         l[0] = 20 ==> no issues

immutable: you cannot change values after assinging
    types: strings, tuple

mutable: values can be changed even after assinging
   types: list, dictonary

Good to know:
@ list of all fucntions for a class: dir
   ex: print dir(dict)
@ try.. except.. finally
  ex: handle = None
  try: 
    handle = open file 
    blah blah
  except file.Error, e:
    print error message
  finally:
    handle.close()
    print all iss well
@ intializing a varaible to null/nil
  h = None
@ First class functions are like funciton pointers
@ if __name__ == 'main' ==> start executing
@ pyinstaller is used to generate an installer file
@ pip install pyinstaller
@ pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
