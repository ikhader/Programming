Basically we have three types of device drivers:
1. char driver: 
      drivers are usually treat devices as files
      implmentation of open, close, read & write are mandated
      console & parleele ports are examples
      accessed by  means of file names like /dev/tty1/ or /dev/lp1
2. block driver
      dirver can host file system such has a disk
      data can only be accessed in fixed block sizes  usually 1KB block
      char & block dirvers are mostly same from developer prospective. Kernal sheilds us from the internals
      char & block diff is only way how data is managed again sheilded by kernal
      
3. network interface
      data exchange with different hosts
      though its hardware based(eth0) it can also be only a software device(lo)
      not begin stream oriented like char & block dirvers kernel handles these network interface differently
