Run 
@ Make: You should see .ko file

insmod: insmod char_device_driver.ko(Must be root user)
to check if installed:
@ lsmod | grep char_device
@ cat /proc/devices 
  expected:  77 Hello World
Testing:
(as root user)  mknod -m 666 /dev/simple_char_device c 77 0
ls -l /dev/simple_char_device
crw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 77, 0 May 22 17:28 /dev/simple_char_device

Notes:
/dev is the filesystem that is in RAM. Destroys after at reboot
cat /proc/devices ==> Gives all the drivers taht are loaded in the system
device drivers:
@ charcter device drivers: stream of bytes. Real time data. Ex: Key board, mouse. We dont access to go back & forth
  ls -l /dev/ | head

  # Linux assosicates every device with a file in /dev folder
  # Linux identifies each device driver with its major number(10 in our case) 
  # Minor number is number of instances of this device(235 in our example)
  
@ block device driver: you can mount a file system. Example usb stick, CD ROM. File access can be done back & forth(Ex: movie skipping few scenes).
